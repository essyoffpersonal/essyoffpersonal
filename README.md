# Essy
## Who am I?
  I'm a beginner programmer. A _very_ beginner programmer. As of writing, I'm working a job at Walmart, and intend to go to school for IT. I have a lot of knowledge with computers, none of it formal.
## What am I doing?
### What have I done?
  * Nothing on a grand scale. _Yet._
### What am I doing _now_?
  * As of this exact time, updating my README.md page.
  * More in general, I'm saving up money from my job at Walmart to build a computer from scratch. It's going to be very run of the mill, but I don't need much more than that.
### What will I be doing?
  * No clue!
